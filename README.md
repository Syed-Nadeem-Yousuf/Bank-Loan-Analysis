# Bank-Loan-Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of bank loan datasets, Finance_1 and Finance_2, which were part of a project during my Data Analytics program. The primary objective of this analysis was to extract meaningful insights and address specific queries provided by the mentor.
The project includes detailed data exploration, analysis, and visualizations to understand trends and patterns in loan data. This work was carried out as part of a team of 4 to 5 members, and we collaboratively solved the objectives using various tools, including Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.

Datasets

Finance_1
•	This dataset contains information on:
•	Loan amount details
•	Borrower profiles
•	Loan statuses

Finance_2
•	This dataset includes:
•	Payment information
•	Verification statuses
•	Home ownership details

These datasets were cleaned, prepared, and merged for analysis where needed.

Objectives

The analysis focused on answering the following key questions:
Year-wise Loan Amount Statistics
•	Analysed how the total loan amounts varied year by year.
Grade and Sub-grade Wise Revolving Balance (revol_bal)
•	Investigated the distribution of revolving balances across different loan grades and sub-grades.

Total Payment for Verified vs Non-Verified Status
•	Compared the total payments made by borrowers with verified and non-verified statuses.

State-wise and Month-wise Loan Status
•	Explored loan status distributions across different states and months.

Home Ownership vs Last Payment Date Statistics
•	Examined the relationship between borrowers' home ownership status and their last payment dates.

Insights Generated

•	Year-wise trends revealed a steady increase in loan issuance, highlighting the financial institution's growth and lending policies.

•	Revolving balances (revol_bal) showed significant variations across loan grades, providing insights into borrowers' creditworthiness

•	Verified borrowers tend to make higher total payments compared to non-verified borrowers, indicating a potential risk assessment factor.

•	Specific states showed higher loan approval rates, while certain months experienced spikes in loan activities.

•	Borrowers with home ownership status showed different payment patterns compared to renters or those with other ownership types.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyse, and extract actionable insights from financial datasets. The repository serves as a showcase of my analytical skills and understanding of real-world data. Working collaboratively as a team and utilizing multiple tools, we successfully solved the same objectives across Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.
